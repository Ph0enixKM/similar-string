...the library for finding string similarities ðŸ”Ž
 
With this library you can easily find rate of similarity of two strings or array of strings.
Under the hood LCS (length finding variant) algorithm is used with O(n * m) time complexity and O(1) memory complexity.

# Example
```rust
use similar_string::{compare_similarity, find_best_similarity};

compare_similarity("age", "page"); // 0.75
find_best_similarity("fight", &vec!["blight", "night", "stride"]); // ("night", 0.8)
```

# LCS Algorithm

You can also use the `lcs_length` that is used under the hood to compute length of longest common subsequence.

```rust
use similar_string::lcs_length;

// The longest common subsequence in this case is "one"
lcs_length("longest", "stone"); // 3
```
